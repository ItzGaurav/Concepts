Binary Serilization

According To MSDN...
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes in order to store the object or transmit it to memory,
a database, or a file. Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. 
The reverse process is called deserialization.

- Binary Serilization is much faster tha other technique.
-A disadvanage is, it is not easily portable to another plateform.
